# PythonColorConsole

A multi platform lightweight script to print using colors in terminals using Python.


It's tested and working with both Python2 and Python3, and on Windows and Linux.
Not tested on Mac.


This script is a mix of many answers and recipes found on internet (stackoverflow, etc...).
I claim no paternity on the full stuff, but I've added some code of my onw and made the full stuff works fine (python3 port for instance).
That's why I publish with the MIT license (see attached file).


I hope it can be usefull to someone, if so, I would be happy to hear it.


Regards,
